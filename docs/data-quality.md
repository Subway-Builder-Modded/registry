# **Data Quality Scoring Guidelines**

This document describes the criterion that will be used to judge the data quality of a specific map or set of maps for [Registry](https://github.com/Subway-Builder-Modded/registry).

The intent for this system is to both measure the objective quality of the raw data bounding the demand modeled within a map (for internal review) and then distill that quality into a single, usable metric for non-technical users (players)

## **1. Criterion**

A Subway Builder map is a closed-system model of how residents within a city normally commute. The provenance of the underlying census / official data bounds how realistic that model can be, and the quality of that data is what this rubric is intended to measure.

Countries around the world publish these statistics in disparate formats and with varying methodologies; this rubric is **NOT** intended to be an exhaustive reference of what can be used to model a Subway Builder map (or macro commute flows in general), but rather to provide a reasonable framework for comparing the relative quality of different data sources and the maps they produce.

This rubric thus scores data quality along **three pillars**, weighted by how much each shapes modeled demand:

| Pillar        | Weight | Captures                                        |
| :------------ | :----: | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Workplace** |  0.50  | the destination side — where the jobs are       |
| **Resident**  |  0.35  | the origin side — where people live             |
| **O/D**       |  0.15  | the pairing — who commutes from where, to where |

**Why these weights?**

- **Workplace — 0.50.** _Workplace data is scored the highest. Workplaces are more concentrated than resident demand, and the nodes they produce within a modeled map are therefore the most load bearing. A concentrated set of destination points is more sensitive to misplacement than origin points, which are more diffuse. And during simulation, destination nodes provide a user with clear structure to work around._
  - _In addition, workplace data is often more difficult to obtain than resident data, and is more likely to be suppressed or estimated. A map that can accurately model workplace demand is therefore more likely to be a high-quality map overall._

- **Resident — 0.35.** _Resident data is scored the second highest; it represents the origin side of every commute and is generally more uniformly distributed than workplace data. While less load-bearing than workplace nodes, residential density provides a solid foundation for modeling commute flows._

- **O/D — 0.15.** _O/D data is scored the lowest; a gravity model can provide approximate (if unrealistic) flows from the origin/destination sides alone, so a measured O/D refines rather than creates demand. However, O/D data is still valuable for macro-flow fidelity which a gravity model would otherwise smooth over._

Within the Workplace and Resident pillars, quality further splits into a **count** (the ground-truth magnitude and the grain it is measured at) and a **dasymetric** (how that count is placed in space within the ground truth grain), as discussed in the following sections.

### **Relationship to the self-reported quality tag**

[Registry](https://github.com/Subway-Builder-Modded/registry) currently records data quality as a single author-declared `source_quality` tag — `high` / `medium` / `low`. That tag is a useful first cut to distinguish map quality, but is limited in several ways this rubric is built to address:

- **Single-axis.** It grades only whether the _source_ is official; it does not ask what was measured, at what grain, how it was placed, or whether any commute flow data was observed. Two `high` maps can differ enormously in actual data quality: a government total at provincial (ADM1) grain and a government block-level (ADM5) census are both "official," yet are wholly different levels of data quality.
- **Self-reported.** Authors grade their own work, so the tag is not comparable across authors and biases the value upwards. This rubric applies objectively the same named tiers to every pipeline, so a map's score is auditable and comparable.
- **Coarse.** The three buckets encompass the full range of scores; this rubric resolves a continuous [0, 1] score for internal use, which can then be mapped to a coarse tier system as needed.
- **Opaque.** A tag says _how good_, never _why_. This rubric is especially userful for map reviewers; the author would now be required to report more granular detail on their source data.

The metric should then be used as a refinement over the existing tag. A `high` / `medium` / `low` split is useful for the end-user (the person using the simulation), and they likely do not need to or want to know the exact methodology or source data the map draws from.

The continuous rubric score resolves into **six named tiers** — very high, high, medium, low, very low, absent (aliased **A**–**F**) — which are themselves a refinement of the registry's three: **very high** and **high** collapse to `high`, **medium** to `medium`, and **low**, **very low** and **absent** to `low`. After review, the rubric-assigned tier therefore **supersedes** `source_quality` rather than rewriting it: existing self-reported tags are frozen for legacy compatibility, and new registry listings initialize the legacy tag from the reviewed tier (via the collapse above) at creation only.

## **2. Granularity**

The quality of the metric being measured by the census/official statistics is secondary to the granularity at which the metric is measured. The finer the measurement granularity, the higher fidelity and detail to which a map can be modeled. Within this document, the following definitions are used:

| Metric Granularity | Description                                                                                                                                            | Examples                                                           |

### **Data Suppression**

When reporting these values, please use the highest granularity data that you have available that does NOT suffer from significant (>5%) privacy-based suppression.

_Some countries will refuse to provide data points that contain only a handful of residents; therefore it is important to cross-check the total metric counts for a particular administrative boundary level against a known unsuppressed ground truth total of a coarser granularity. If the totals mismatch greatly, it is likely the artifact of data suppression._

### **Choosing the grain for hybrid or ambiguous sources**

Granularity scores the grain at which a count's **magnitude** is measured — not the finer grain it may ultimately be placed at (that finer placement is credited in the [Dasymetric](#3-dasymetric) section). Some sources blur the two: a total measured at a coarse unit is redistributed to finer units that carry their own partial signal. To resolve which grain to score:

1. **Find where the magnitude is actually measured.** A total published per municipality and then spread across buildings by a model is _measured_ at the municipality — score that grain; the finer placement earns its credit only in the dasymetric (R × I).
2. **Determine whether the finer units carry independent magnitude information of their own.** If they do (e.g. establishment employee-size bands, per-building dwelling counts), the finer grain is partly measured, not pure interpolation, and the effective grain sits **between** the coarse anchor and the fine unit; for example:
   - Exact per-unit counts (e.g. block-level headcounts) => score the **fine** grain.
   - A partial per-unit signal (e.g. size _bands_ constrained to a coarse total) => score a **middle** grain.
   - No independent finer signal (a coarse total spread by geometry alone) => score the **coarse** grain.
3. **When it remains ambiguous, take the middle and record the bounds** so the call is auditable. _Example:_ Mexico's workplace magnitude is measurable at varying granularities: ~ADM2 (municipal) as a floor, with some industry counts available at ~ADM3/4 level. In addition, the establishment directory carries real employee-size bands at address level (ADM5). Within the rubric, it is thus scored at **~ADM4**, between the coarser ADM2 (total-only resolution floor) and the finer ADM5 (treat the establishments as measured units).

## **3. Dasymetric**

A **dasymetric** distributes a count in space _below_ the grain at which it is measured ([Granularity](#2-granularity)). It is shared by the Workplace and Resident pillars — scored identically for both — as the product of two independent factors:

`dasymetric_score = R × I`

- **Spatial Resolution (R)** — how finely mass can be placed (the geometry / coverage available).
- **Intensity Fidelity (I)** — how well the mass is apportioned among those candidate locations.

Splitting them lets the rubric distinguish a method that fits per-type densities to the area's ground truth total from one that spreads building mass with a flat prior, even when both draw on the same building layer. The tiers are identical for workplace and resident; only the example sources differ (noted inline).

A dasymetric is important when the base ground truth grain is coarser than the expected demand-point grain of the map. A map with points only at ADM3 (municipal) grain will be far less usable as a model (and far less engaging to simulate) than one with points at ADM5 (sub-municipal) grain, even if both are drawn from the same ADM3 ground truth total. The dasymetric is what allows the model to place demand nodes at a finer grain than the base ground truth, and a strongly constrained dasymetric enables maps with otherwise poor resolution to place well-scaled nodes at realistic locations.

When properly applied, a dasymetric can also help mitigate the effects of data suppression. If a census mesh cell is suppressed, but the dasymetric has a building footprint overlay, an approximate mass can still be placed in the "correct" location.

## **4. Workplace**

_The most important pillar, accounting for half of the weighted score. Scored as **count** (below) × **dasymetric** (the shared [Dasymetric](#3-dasymetric) R × I ladders)._

### **Workplace Count Ground Truth**

The physical/registered split is not binary. Census place-of-work questions and establishment censuses **measure** physical work location; some registers have the statistics office **infer** it; others take the firm's **self-declared** address as the workplace location. The following table describes the different workplace-count anchors and their relative weights.

Scored via the shared **[Dasymetric](#3-dasymetric)** ladders (R × I). Resident-specific: intensity is per-building **dwelling** counts or residential floor area (not per-class NACE) — see the _Resident_ rows in [Dasymetric](#3-dasymetric).

## **6. O/D Shaping**

_The lightest pillar (weight 0.15) — see [Criterion](#1-criterion) for why._

Origin-Destination pairs, or O/D matrices of any granularity help shape the map’s fidelity to real-world commute flows.

In the absence of O/D data pairs, a pure gravity-bound model can be used, but this will smooth over macro-level commute flows.

_Note that a pipeline at the **0.0 rung that has measured marginals** (real resident + job totals per area) is 0.0 **as-built, but 0.25-capable**. With an IPF / doubly-constrained pass over its existing marginals, the pipeline can be lifted to 0.25 with no new data, meaning the gap is a modeling choice, not a data limitation. A pipeline whose marginals are **fabricated** (such as UA) cannot reach 0.25 without acquiring real marginals; one with **no marginals at all** (e.g. MA) cannot reach 0.1 without acquiring a prior._

## **8. Composite Score**

Every pipeline resolves to a single **weighted score** in [0, 1] and a named quality tier; the rest of this section defines how that score is built.

| Tier          | Grade | Weighted Score |
| :------------ | :---: | :------------- |
| **Very high** |   A   | ≥ 0.75         |
| **High**      |   B   | 0.60 – 0.75    |
| **Medium**    |   C   | 0.45 – 0.60    |
| **Low**       |   D   | 0.30 – 0.45    |
| **Very low**  |   E   | 0.15 – 0.30    |
| **Absent**    |   F   | < 0.15         |
| **Unknown**   |   U   | N/A            |

_Tiers apply to the **weighted** (player-facing) score, and refine the current three-level tag system: **very high** and **high** map to `high`, **medium** to `medium`, and **low** / **very low** / **absent** to `low`._

_The **absent** tier (grade F) is reserved for pipelines with no usable census anchor — the granularity multiplier floors the score at ~0 by construction, categorically apart from a map that is weakly grounded in census data._

_The **unknown** tier (grade U) is reserved for pipelines that have not been scored yet, to enable backwards compatibility for pipelines/maps that have yet to be scored._

_Tiers are heterogeneous — a given tier can arise from different strength/weakness profiles across the three pillars. The **grade** letter alias (A–F) is kept for brevity._

The **raw composite score** combines the three scored pillars from the tables above. Each pillar multiplies its **count ground truth**, its **dasymetric** (`R × I`, [Dasymetric](#3-dasymetric)), and a **granularity multiplier** `G` for the grain at which that pillar's count is measured. The pillars are then weighted with **workplace > resident > O/D** as described in [Criterion](#1-criterion). The raw score is a number in [0, 1].

```text
workplace_raw = count_w × (R_w × I_w) × G(gran_w)
resident_raw  = count_r × (R_r × I_r) × G(gran_r)
od_raw       = score_od           × G(gran_od)

raw_score = 0.50 · workplace_raw  +  0.35 · resident_raw  +  0.15 · od_raw
```

Given that factors are in [0, 1], the _raw score_ is in [0, 1]. The product form inside each pillar is **weakest-link**: a strong count spread by a weak dasymetric — or any pillar anchored at a coarse grain — is penalized, which is the intent for an internal-review metric.

A second score, the **weighted composite score**, replaces the product inside each pillar with a half-and-half average — `pillar_weighted = (0.5 · count + 0.5 · R·I) × G` — which is more forgiving of a single weak sub-factor and yields a more spread-out, player-facing scale. Note that O/D has no split, so it stays `score_od × G` in both.

Both composite scores combine pillars with the same `0.50 · workplace + 0.35 · resident + 0.15 · od` weights; the table reports both.

**Granularity multiplier (G)** — read off the Granularity ladder:

| Grain                                          | G    |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :--- |
| Mesh — very-fine, uniform (≤125 m)             | 1.00 |
| Mesh — fine (≤250 m)                           | 0.95 |
| Mesh — medium (≤500 m)                         | 0.90 |
| Mesh — coarse (≤1 km)                          | 0.85 |
| Mesh — very-coarse (>1 km)                     | 0.65 |
| Measured-pop ADM5 unit (census block / sub-里) | 0.95 |
| Sub-municipal (ADM4)                           | 0.90 |
| Municipal (ADM3)                               | 0.70 |
| Regional (ADM2)                                | 0.50 |
| Provincial (ADM1)                              | 0.30 |
| None                                           | 0.00 |

_Mesh tiers are graded by **cell size in meters** — a uniform grid gives consistent resolution everywhere (especially in rural areas). Admin tiers are rated by their **typical** size, which varies widely and is usually far larger than the tier name implies: gminy are often 100+ km², obce / city-districts routinely > 1 km². So a uniform 1 km grid (0.85) outscores a municipality (ADM3, 0.70), and the two ladders are **not** equivalent. A measured-population ADM5 unit (census block, sub-里) is the exception: it is small and measured, so it sits with the fine-mesh tier._

The raw (weakest-link product) column is retained as the sterner internal view.

_OSM (patcher): the `Subway-Builder-Modded/map-manager` pipeline (an early community OSM patcher), scored as the true floor of the scale. It uses **no census or official statistics at all** — resident and job counts are derived entirely from OSM building footprints × `building:levels`, multiplied by hardcoded square-feet-per-person / square-feet-per-job constants (the source comments call it "all vibes"). Neighborhoods are Voronoi cells around OSM place-nodes, and the O/D "matrix" is a synthetic jobs-share × population product with no distance decay. Because no count magnitude is ever **measured**, the granularity multiplier is **None (G = 0)**, which zeroes every pillar regardless of how the OSM footprints are placed — so it scores **0.00**. It is the concrete illustration of what "no census bounding" costs: with no real magnitude to place, spatial detail is worthless._

_Initially, all pipelines are **unscored** (grade U) until a reviewer has worked with teh submitter to define the three pillars and the O/D metric. The unscored tier is a placeholder and is not at all a judgment of the map's data quality._

### **Worked examples — one per tier**

Each country is shown with both composites: **raw** (weakest-link `count × (R·I) × G`) and **weighted** (half-and-half `(0.5·count + 0.5·R·I) × G`, the graded number). O/D has no split — it is `score_od × G` in both. Pillars combine as `0.50 · workplace + 0.35 · resident + 0.15 · od`.

- **Very high — JP.** Physical 経済センサス worker mesh (500 m) · employed residents (250 m mesh, ADM4) · full municipal O/D matrix (ADM3).
  - _Raw_ — workplace `1.0 × (0.85×1.0) × 0.90 = 0.765`, resident `= 0.765`, od `1.0 × 0.70 = 0.70` → `0.50·0.765 + 0.35·0.765 + 0.15·0.70` = **0.76**.
  - _Weighted_ — workplace `0.925 × 0.90 = 0.83`, resident `= 0.83`, od `0.70` → `0.50·0.83 + 0.35·0.83 + 0.15·0.70` = **0.81**.
- **High — TW.** Physical count on NLSC cadastre + calibrated fit (municipal) · working-age on MSA sub-里 measured-pop blocks · structured marginals (ADM3).
  - _Raw_ — workplace `1.0 × (1.0×0.85) × 0.70 = 0.595`, resident `0.7 × (0.9×1.0) × 0.90 = 0.567`, od `0.75 × 0.70 = 0.525` → **0.57**.
  - _Weighted_ — workplace `0.925 × 0.70 = 0.648`, resident `0.80 × 0.90 = 0.720`, od `0.525` → **0.65**.
- **Medium — LT.** Physical on GRPK cadastre · employed residents (250 m mesh) · synthetic O/D from two measured marginals (no grain multiplier).
  - _Raw_ — workplace `1.0 × (1.0×0.85) × 0.70 = 0.595`, resident `1.0 × (0.85×1.0) × 0.70 = 0.595`, od `0.25` → **0.54**.
  - _Weighted_ — workplace `0.925 × 0.70 = 0.648`, resident `= 0.648`, od `0.25` → **0.59**.
- **Low — CN.** Physical 5th Economic Census count on ML footprints (binary commercial/residential split, 街道 / ADM4) · total population (same footprints & grain) · no O/D (unbounded gravity).
  - _Raw_ — workplace `1.0 × (0.7×0.4) × 0.90 = 0.252`, resident `0.4 × (0.7×0.4) × 0.90 = 0.101`, od `0.00` → **0.16**.
  - _Weighted_ — workplace `0.64 × 0.90 = 0.576`, resident `0.34 × 0.90 = 0.306`, od `0.00` → **0.40**.
- **Very low — UA.** Estimated proxy on ML footprints (oblast grain) · total population (hromada grain) · prior-informed synthetic O/D (GIPF calibrated on analogue flows).
  - _Raw_ — workplace `0.3 × (0.7×0.6) × 0.30 = 0.038`, resident `0.4 × (0.7×0.6) × 0.70 = 0.118`, od `0.10` → **0.08**.
  - _Weighted_ — workplace `0.36 × 0.30 = 0.108`, resident `0.41 × 0.70 = 0.287`, od `0.10` → **0.17**.
- **Absent — OSM patcher.** No census anchor anywhere, so `G = 0` zeroes every pillar regardless of footprint placement.
  - _Raw_ — workplace `0.0 × (0.6×0.2) × 0 = 0.00`, resident `= 0.00`, od `0.00` → **0.00**.
  - _Weighted_ — workplace `(0.5·0.0 + 0.5·0.13) × 0 = 0.00`, resident `= 0.00`, od `0.00` → **0.00**.

## **9. Unscored Metrics**

These considerations are not part of the score, but they meaningfully affect how much a map can be trusted and should be mentioned wherever they apply. They are listed in rough descending order of impact — from those that can materially shift modeled demand, through a bias worth flagging, down to a common point of confusion that is not a quality signal at all.

### **Absolute Anchor**

Each Subway Builder map is a closed-system model of a real-world open system. Maps within the simulation cannot render any points outside of a certain boundary, whereas in real life any map bounds would most certainly be porous.

The absolute anchor of the map is which total (employed residents / workplaces) the map is scaled towards, and whether or not the map models those workers who live outside of the boundary, or those residents who work outside of the boundary.

Choosing to model only those persons who both live and work within the map boundary is a design choice, but it should be noted that this will reduce the relative magnitude of modeled commute flows and may skew against nodes located at the periphery.

### **Special Demand — a separate layer, outside the normal modeled flow**

The three scored pillars cover **commute** demand — the normal home → work flow the map models. Most pipelines also inject **special-demand** points that are deliberately **not** part of that normal modeled flow: attractions (museums, temples, stadiums, ski resorts, etc.), hospitals, airports, ports and other generators of unique trips.

These are generally modeled using a visitor or throughput magnitude as an analogue to commuter traffic. Because it is a different kind of demand, and is net-optional for a submitted map, this layer is deliberately **not** scored.

A map with a well-cited special-demand layer is materially better than one that invents attraction weights, even when the two score identically on the commute pillars, but that distinction is not captured in this rubric.

### **Data Vintage & Temporal Coherence**

Some census / official data is of COVID-vintage, wherein O/D is lower than normal, and WFH (work from home) rates are higher. This rubric does not attempt to penalize COVID-vintage data, as even though it may be less representative of the pre-COVID world, it is still a real-world measurement.

Separately, a single map can be assembled from layers of **different vintages**. For example, a reasonable methodology may include a residence census, a workplace / economic census usually published a year or more later, a current building-footprint snapshot, and a special-demand layer whose figures may span many years. This modest, systematic lag between the residence and workplace censuses is normal and accepted (the two are rarely published concurrently).

The looser risk is the special-demand layer, which is left primarily to the discretion of the mapper and may lack any vintage constraint whatsoever; a single map can blend a pre-pandemic tourism peak, a recent municipal survey, and an undated estimate side by side. Special demand does not inherently factor into this rubric's final score, so this risk is noted rather than scored.

### **Informal Employment**

Some census data attempts to capture the full breadth of employment within a country by estimating informal employment (or garnering such data via survey). Herein lies a potential source of bias in the data, as informal employment is often more prevalent in certain sectors (e.g. construction, agriculture) and may be more spatially diffuse than formal employment, and certain countries will exhibit much higher rates of informal employment than others.

This rubric does not attempt to score informal employment, as modeling it explicitly is a design choice, but it is worth noting that a map that does not model informal employment may be less realistic than one that does.

### **Point-Placement Detail — distinct from input quality**

How finely a map ultimately places demand points is a performance / UX choice, **not** a measure of input-data quality, and the two must not be conflated. A generator may agglomerate, cull, or merge fine-grained input into fewer rendered points for engine performance without lowering its score as the ground-truth input is unchanged.

Two examples of this include the US demand generator's agglomeration mechanic, wherein multiple LODES RAC points are merged into a single point for the purposes of in-simulation rendered quality/performance, and the shared EU/JP/TW pipeline's merging of runt/residual points below a certain population threshold in the densest areas of each map.
