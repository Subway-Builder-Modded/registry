## 2026-08-12 — jp-maps only-latest asset retirement wiped 183 version counts (corrected, prevention shipped)

**What happened:** jp-data's `publish_map_pack.py --only-latest-download`
(PoR §12.2) deletes superseded release assets from
`ahkimn/subwaybuilder-jp-maps` so stale/differently-watermarked artifacts 404.
The 2026-08-12T23:40Z hourly run (#7693) saw those versions stop resolving and
dropped them from `maps/downloads.json` entirely: **183 versions across 50
yukina listings, 16,297 recorded downloads**, 49 listings left with empty
download maps. `applyVersionBucketMonotonicCounts` only emitted versions
present in the fresh resolution; the version-bucket ledger retained every
retired version's counts, but nothing carried them into the output.

**Correction:** the 183 versions were restored into `maps/downloads.json` at
their exact pre-wipe committed values (`f29481065`, the analytics run minutes
before the wipe). Ledger versions that had already fallen out of
`downloads.json` **before** this wipe (21 versions across 16 other listings,
mostly `legacy:`-seeded entries last seen 2026-04-05 or drops during the
2026-07-08 429-cascade window) were deliberately **not** restored — their
provenance is uncertain and several overlap earlier incident eras.

**Prevention:** `applyVersionBucketMonotonicCounts` now carries forward any
version present in the previously committed `downloads.json` that the fresh
run did not produce, at its last committed value (both the hourly/full
pipeline and `reconcile-attributed-downloads`). Keyed on the committed output
— not the ledger — so pre-guard drops stay dropped and hand-removing an entry
from `downloads.json` still sticks. This also closes the residual
transient-failure path where a resolution outage could zero recorded counts.
The tw-maps and eu-maps packs will adopt the same only-latest retirement
policy; no registry-side action is needed when they do.

**Residual effect:** retired versions' counts are frozen at their final
observed values and no longer track upstream (the assets 404). busan-3/cairo
style re-tag history (`vX.Y.Z` rows alongside `X.Y.Z`) remains as-is.

## 2026-08-07 → 2026-08-26 — French-map re-download loop after city-code re-releases (CLOSED; corrections applied throughout)

**What happened:** the base game's 2026-08 update shipped vanilla Lyon/Marseille/Paris
whose city codes collided with pierreggt's modded listings, so all three re-released
under new codes (`LYS`→`LSY`, `MRS`→`MAR`, `PAR`→`PRS`; registry metadata
PRs #7142/#7144/#7146, merged 2026-08-09). The Railyard app resolves an installed map's
expected disk location from the *manifest's* (latest) city code, but a pinned old
version's files live under the *old* code — so on every launch the app silently
dropped the map from installed state and subscription sync re-downloaded the pinned
old version, in a loop (fixed by monorepo PR #615). Old-version counters inflated
from 2026-08-07/08: `paris-ile-de-france` v1.0.0 jumped from a ~29/day baseline to
63/146/119/113/87/75 per day (Aug 7–12); lyon/marseille v1.0.0 saw only marginal
excess (small install bases).

**Correction:** spec-driven, re-runnable repair via
`scripts/ops/repair-loop-inflated-downloads.ts` with spec
`history/loop-repair-specs/2026_08_13_french_city_code_loop.json`. The organic
allowance is two-phase, keyed on each target's `superseded_start` (the first
snapshot day its successor version was available, 2026-08-08 for all three):
before it (old version still the latest) the pre-incident baseline rate applies
(2026-07-24 → 2026-08-06 raw day-deltas); from it on, only the **superseded-peer
rate** — pooled post-supersession old-version traffic of the four yukina JP maps
whose old versions were superseded the same week (0.69/day pooled; every
comparable, including 800-1500-install maps like amsterdam/berlin-val, drops to
~0-2/day once a successor exists, so pre-incident demand must NOT be carried into
the superseded window). All allowance means are rounded UP so estimation errs
toward attributing less. Excess is attributed as one manual-attribution delta per
(listing, version, day) with stable delta ids
(`manual-loop-repair:french-city-code-loop-2026-08:<id>@<version>:<date>`), so
re-runs are idempotent and only newly observed days apply. The same run clamps the
affected snapshot trajectories to the organic estimate (min-guarded, mirroring the
charleston clamp — prevents `history-max:` reseeding), lowers the version-bucket
ceilings, and lowers `downloads.json` (self-heals upward on the next hourly
reconcile for downloads that arrived after the last snapshot).

**NEW-version traffic is also affected for lyon/marseille:** early updaters whose
clients still held a pre-merge manifest (old city code) looped on the *new* asset,
and client manifest-cache staleness smeared this past the 2026-08-09 merge —
lyon v1.0.2 pulled 0.74× its install base in 5 days and marseille v1.0.2 1.28×
(more copies than installs), against a 0.10–0.35× organic envelope measured across
peer updates. These are corrected via `adoption_targets` in the same spec: the
allowance is the **peer-adoption curve** — for each day since release, the most
generous per-day adoption fraction of install base observed across the same-week
yukina updates (`adoption_peers`), scaled to the target's cumulative pre-release
base and rounded UP. paris v1.0.5 sits inside the peer envelope (0.31×, curve
matching yukina-sendai) and is deliberately NOT targeted.

**Applied 2026-08-13** (peer-based estimates, superseding an initial 427-fetch
baseline-only estimate that was reverted before publication): **820 fetches**
attributed for days 2026-08-07 → 2026-08-12 — old versions 595
(paris-ile-de-france v1.0.0: 568 → display 1434 → 866; lyon v1.0.0: 14;
marseille v1.0.0: 13) and new versions 225 (lyon v1.0.2: 83 → display 127 → 44;
marseille v1.0.2: 142 → display 177 → 35), 6 snapshots clamped.

**Closure (2026-08-26):** the repair was re-applied on cadence through the
incident (Aug 13–18: 437 fetches; Aug 19–24: 216; final Aug 25–26 window: 34 —
**~1,540 total spurious fetches attributed** across the incident). Each leg
stopped when its structural cause was removed, not by client-update decay
alone: lyon settled at allowance ~08-20 (app v0.2.10, released 08-17,
covering its case); marseille's churn hit zero on 08-23, two days after its
`MAR`→`MRS` revert + v2 release landed (the vanilla collision had made
v1.0.2 uninstallable, so v0.2.10 alone could not stop it); paris v1.0.0
looped at ~28-45/day until its V2 metadata cutover (`PAR`→`PRS`, pack update
URL) merged 2026-08-25 — the old-manifest resolution the loop depended on
disappeared and the counter went 31 → 0 overnight. A registry-side pipeline
bug (V8 argument-limit stack overflow on the ~144k-point paris V2 map) had
blocked that cutover for three days and was fixed in the same arc.
`incident_end: 2026-08-26` is set in the spec and a final `--apply` ran.
After any attribution-ledger rebuild, re-apply this spec like the
manual-attribution specs (ops/README.md). With the incident closed, the
migration-reserved `LYS` code was released (`RESERVED_CITY_CODES` is empty
again); `LSY` remains lyon's code.

**Prevention (registry side):** `VANILLA_CITY_CODES` in
`scripts/lib/map-constants.ts` was missing the entire 2026-08 game update (per the
live `ctiles.subwaybuilder.com/cities/latest-cities.yml`: `PAR`/`LYO`/`MAR` for the
French cities — NOT the `LYS`/`MRS` this incident was first written up against —
plus `NO`, `RAL`, `SAC`, `KC`, `NAS`, `DUB`, `NEW`) and several older game code
spellings (`SF`, `DC`, `LA`, `BIR`, `COL`). All added, and the list is now synced
**automatically**: `sync-vanilla-city-codes` (4-hourly analytics workflow) fetches
the live game list into `maps/vanilla-city-codes.json` (monotonic union — codes are
never dropped), and intake validation unions that file with the hardcoded floor via
`loadVanillaCityCodeSet`.

**Vanilla-collision epilogue (both resolved):**

- **`marseille`** — the 2026-08-09 re-release had renamed `MRS` directly onto
  the vanilla `MAR`, making v1.0.2 uninstallable on updated games. Resolved
  2026-08-20 by reverting to `MRS` (which was never vanilla; it had only been
  maintainer-reserved during the migration and was released back to its
  original holder) plus the v2 release.
- **`dublin`** — collided with vanilla `DUB`; the listing was deprecated by
  its author 2026-08-17, and the conflict scanner now skips deprecated
  listings, so no rename is needed unless it is ever undeprecated.

## 2026-08-04 → 2026-08-05 — Private-repo wipe of three mod listings (fully recovered, listings deprecated)

**What happened:** two authors made their source repos private, and the
download pipeline treated "repository not found" as *fresh emptiness* rather
than *unknown state*. GitHub's GraphQL reports a private/deleted repo as a
non-transient "Could not resolve to a Repository" error, which landed the
repo in **neither** `repoIndexes` **nor** `unavailableRepos` — so the
preserve-previous-counts fallback (which only fires for `unavailableRepos`,
i.e. transient 429/5xx errors) was never reached, and the freshly-initialized
`{}` was written out. Affected listings and losses:

- `danield1909-dantrains` (repo private ~Aug 4 20:30–21:05 UTC): hourly run
  `c592e548d` (#6961) wiped 12 versions, 2,300 → 57 (the 57 survived only via
  a pre-existing `mods/grandfathered-downloads.json` entry).
- `imb11-moveit` (1,255) and `imb11-subwaycine` (33) (repos private Aug 5
  ~21:03–22:07 UTC): hourly run `4df45a6e2` (#7048) wiped both to `{}`.

The wipes surfaced as **negative net-delta** figures in the hourly Discord
report (e.g. `mods.net_downloads: -1158` in `snapshot_2026_08_05.json`).

**Why the two authors' listings diverged:** the same gap existed in **full**
mode (`regenerate-registry-analytics`, 4-hourly), where the `!repoIndex`
branch additionally clobbered the listing's integrity entry with a fresh
empty one. dantrains went private ~4 hours before a full run, so the Aug 5
00:15 full run (`97705a745`) collapsed its integrity
(`has_complete_version: false`) — which the Railyard app treats as
purge-on-launch. The imb11 repos went private ~90 minutes *after* the Aug 5
20:29 full run (`a90d48590`), and only hourly download-only runs (which never
write integrity) saw the 404 — so their integrity entries remained intact.
Pure cadence timing, not different handling.

**Fix:** the `!repoIndex` (repository-not-found) branches now preserve
previous state exactly like the `unavailableRepos` (transient) branches, in
all four sites: listing-level and per-version paths in both
`scripts/lib/downloads-download-only.ts` and `scripts/lib/downloads-full.ts`
(full mode preserves integrity + cache + downloads together). Regression
tests cover the private/deleted-repo case in both modes
(`downloads.integration.test.ts`).

**Recovery:** last-known per-version counts were intact in
`mods/download-version-buckets.json` (monotonic ledger; the wipe couldn't
touch it because `applyVersionBucketMonotonicCounts` only iterates versions
present in the fresh result). All three listings' counts were restored from
the ledger into `mods/downloads.json` **and** frozen into
`mods/grandfathered-downloads.json` (dantrains 2,433 / moveit 1,255 /
subwaycine 33 — bucket maxes, slightly above the last snapshot values by
design). **No lasting data loss.**

**Snapshot correction:** `history/snapshot_2026_08_05.json` (generated 04:01,
between the two wipes) had recorded dantrains post-wipe (57) and
`mods.net_downloads: -1158`. Corrected to the exact last observation before
the repo vanished (21:05 Aug 4 run, `c592e548d^`): adjusted 2,300 per-version,
raw = adjusted + the per-version attribution map (275, static since Aug 1),
`mods.net_downloads: +1085`. This is a reconstruction from committed data,
not an estimate — the repo was unreachable for the entire window between the
last observation and the snapshot, so no downloads could have been recorded.
The imb11 wipe (22:07 Aug 5) never reached a daily snapshot; Aug 1–4
snapshots are clean.

**Deprecation:** all three listings were deprecated in the same change
(maintainer-initiated, `by_github_id: 268817724`) since no installable
versions remain. The grandfathered entries are what keep their download
totals visible: the deprecation overlay wipes deprecated listings from the
pipeline's own output, and the grandfathered merge re-fills every version
afterwards. The app-side purge of installed copies on deprecation is a known,
accepted side effect (revisit possibly in 0.2.10); dantrains installs had
already been purging since Aug 5 00:15 via the integrity collapse.

**Detection playbook for recurrence:** a listing dropping non-zero → `{}` in
`downloads.json` alongside a "skipped all github-release versions
(repository not found or inaccessible)" warning means the repo vanished
upstream. With the fix, counts and integrity are preserved automatically and
the warning reads "preserved previous … (repository not found or
inaccessible)" instead; the remaining action is deciding whether to
deprecate the listing (grandfather its counts first if so).

## 2026-04 → 2026-07 — charleston-huntington-wv faulty-client inflation (corrected 2026-07-29)

**What happened:** an automated client repeatedly re-downloaded the map's
**re-uploaded** `CHA.zip` asset (the re-upload gave the asset a new node id
and reset GitHub's counter; the original asset's count was frozen at 5 on
2026-04-11 as part of the April grandfathering). The listing climbed 5 → 800
at a metronomic **~8–10 downloads/day from mid-April through June**, with
increments spread around the clock — including ~03:00 US Eastern for a small
West Virginia–audience map — then cliffed to ~2/day in early July with no
release event. Registry-wide screens (metronomic-growth and July-cliff
signatures across all maps and mods) found no other listing with this
pattern; every other candidate resolved to organic popularity or version
supersession.

**Correction:** peer-scaled organic estimate of **65** (versus small-metro
peers at 18–206 lifetime); **735 downloads attributed to the faulty client**.
Applied across every path that could resurrect the inflated value:

- `+735` manual attribution on the asset's base key (prefix matching covers
  all node-id re-uploads) via `create-manual-download-attribution --apply`;
  the spec is committed at
  `history/manual-attribution-specs/2026_07_28_charleston_huntington_faulty_client.json`
  and re-application is idempotent (`applied_delta_ids`).
- Version-bucket max/last lowered to 65 (both download writers are
  monotonic and would otherwise hold 800 forever).
- `maps/downloads.json` set to 65.
- 106 `history/snapshot_*.json` files re-interpolated (linear 5 → 65 over
  the bot window, never exceeding the recorded value) via
  `scripts/ops/backfill-charleston-snapshot-clamp.ts`, so bucket rebuilds
  from history no longer seed an inflated `history-max:` floor.

**Re-application rules** (see `scripts/ops/README.md`): after any
attribution-ledger rebuild, re-apply the committed manual-attribution specs;
after any snapshot rebuild from git, re-run the charleston clamp script.

**Residual effect:** the listing's historical trajectory Apr–Jul is a
corrected estimate. Going forward the count grows organically once the
asset's raw counter exceeds 800 (`adjusted = raw − 735`).

**Detection notes:** the tell was the combination of (1) rate wildly
disproportionate to the map's audience, (2) metronomic day-over-day
constancy, (3) increments in dead local-time hours, (4) an abrupt rate
cliff untied to any release, and (5) an asset re-upload restarting the
counter right as the pattern began.

## 2026-07-28 — GitHub release download-counter stall (no correction applied)

**Window:** ~08:00–19:20 UTC (≈11.5 hours).

**What happened:** GitHub's release-asset `download_count` metric stopped
incrementing platform-wide. Downloads themselves continued to be served; only
the counters froze. Verified against three independent sources: registry map
counts, the Railyard app's own release repo
(`Subway-Builder-Modded/railyard` — hourly snapshots in
`history/railyard_app_downloads.json` show `0.2.9` pinned at 1295 from 16:00
through 19:00 UTC), and an external control repo (`yt-dlp/yt-dlp`, normally
~70 downloads/minute, byte-identical across samples at 19:12–19:17 UTC).

**Registry symptom:** hourly `regenerate-downloads` PRs carried identical
diffs for hours, then pure "+0" cycles after the frozen snapshot merged
(#6275). The pipeline itself was verified healthy — fetches succeeded and
stored values matched `live_raw − attributed` exactly throughout.

**Impact:** the stall window recorded **+37** net downloads versus a
**~1,774–1,878** baseline for the same window on the two preceding days.
When counters resumed (~19:20 UTC), GitHub replayed only a small fraction of
the backlog (≲100 across the registry; post-recovery hourly cycles landed
inside the normal same-hour baseline band). **≈1,700 downloads registry-wide
are permanently unrecorded.**

**Decision:** accepted without correction. The cause is external and
verifiable, the loss is a single-window dip well inside week-scale variance,
and any backfill would have required fabricating per-version estimates —
contrary to the conservative-corrections policy. Interpret the Jul 28
daily totals accordingly.

**Detection playbook for recurrence:** hourly PRs going "+0/+0" (or repeating
identical diffs) while run logs show successful fetches → spot-check
`stored == live_raw − attributed` for a busy listing, then sample a
high-traffic external repo's `download_count` twice a few minutes apart. If
the control is frozen, it is a platform incident: change nothing, let the
cumulative-counter pipeline pick up whatever GitHub reports after recovery,
and record the measured gap here.

## 2026-07-08 → 2026-07-09 — Integrity cache wipe + 429 cascade (fully recovered)

**What happened:** a sequence of integrity-pipeline bugs wiped download
counts and integrity data for 20+ map listings across analytics runs
#4418–#4449 (~3,000 downloads temporarily zeroed). Three stacked root
causes:

1. **`INTEGRITY_RULES_VERSION` bump (v6 → v7)** invalidated every existing
   cache entry; the next analytics run re-inspected all versions under the
   new phantom-points check and retroactively failed grandfathered versions
   (`is_complete: false` → undownloadable). Reverted to `v6`; integrity
   files restored from `ae1322f5d`. **Standing rule: never bump
   `INTEGRITY_RULES_VERSION`** — new versions always get fresh inspection
   with all current checks anyway (new fingerprints), while existing cache
   entries must stay valid.
2. **429 cascade:** `fetchCustomVersions` hit `raw.githubusercontent.com`
   unauthenticated with no pacing; burst requests triggered secondary rate
   limits, and transiently-errored listings had empty integrity entries
   written over their previous state. Fixed in `dcb0b9cbe`
   (transient-error listings preserve previous integrity/cache/stats) and
   `a74d7ea7c` (200ms inter-fetch pacing).
3. **Phantom-points check on cache-empty listings:** with the cache wiped
   by (2), re-inspections fired the new `demand_phantom_points` /
   `demand_residents_match` checks against pre-existing versions, silently
   dropping their counts to 0 on every run until the cache was repopulated.

**Recovery:** integrity + cache + download counts restored from last
known-good commits in `a88f8e81b`, `1746fb8a8`, and `17fb22550`/`f501f7518`
(2026-07-09). **No lasting data loss** — counts and integrity state were
fully recovered from git history.

**Detection/recovery playbook:** listings dropping non-zero → 0 in
`downloads.json`, or appearing in `incomplete_versions` with
`demand_phantom_points: false` after previously being complete. Restore
integrity entries **and cache entries and download counts together in one
commit** from the last known-good analytics commit — without the cache
restore, the next run re-inspects and the cycle repeats.

## 2026-04-07 → 2026-04-10 — App-side download inflation + integrity invalidation (corrected)

Two related problems, corrected as of 2026-04-11.

### Part 1: inflated download spike (corrected by proportional haircut)

**What happened:** Apr 7–10 download counts spiked artificially from
app-side request behavior, inflating registry counts far above organic
levels.

**Correction:** Apr 6 was the last verifiably clean snapshot and served as
the baseline (deliberately *not* the first spiked date — hard-capping at
Apr 7 would have discarded legitimate organic growth). Each spiked snapshot
was scaled as:

```
corrected = max(apr6Baseline, floor(original × DELTA_HAIRCUT_RATIO))
DELTA_HAIRCUT_RATIO = 0.2864   # weighted avg clamped/pre-clamp across 8 affected mods (1173/4095)
```

Applied by `scripts/backfill-map-version-clamp.ts`.

### Part 2: 14 map versions invalidated by integrity checks (grandfathered)

**What happened:** 14 map versions failed the `config_version_matches_tag`
integrity check (the version in `config.json` did not match the GitHub
release tag). The pipeline marks such versions incomplete and excludes them,
which would have silently dropped their historical download totals —
violating the monotonic non-decrease requirement.

**Correction:** their counts were frozen in
`maps/grandfathered-downloads.json` (the authoritative list of affected
versions and frozen values); `mergeGrandfatheredDownloads()` in
`scripts/lib/grandfathered-downloads.ts` merges the frozen counts back into
pipeline output for incomplete versions only.

**If new versions are invalidated in the future:** add them to
`maps/grandfathered-downloads.json` using the last clean snapshot value from
git history, and check the ceilings in `maps/download-version-buckets.json`.

**Residual effect:** Apr 7–10 totals are corrected estimates, not raw
measurements; the 14 grandfathered versions carry frozen counts that no
longer track upstream.
